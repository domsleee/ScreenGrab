# Publish to homebrew

* I don't want to bother with publishing to app store
* I want to distribute like this app: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace
* Help me make it happen.

## What I think is needed

* github action to do a release. I would suggest every commit to main
* Another repo for homebrew tap. domsleee/homebrew-tap?
